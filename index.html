      <p>
        I'm a software engineer with over 4 years of experience building high-performance applications and systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time at TCS, I worked on multiple projects that focused on improving system efficiency and optimizing cloud infrastructure. I was involved in building and maintaining high-performance backend systems, improving API functionality, and automating cloud infrastructure to ensure scalability and reliability. My work included designing and optimizing databases, as well as implementing solutions that enhanced system performance and reduced operational costs. I also collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver solutions that aligned with business objectives, ensuring the infrastructure was both cost-effective and resilient.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently completed my Masterâ€™s at San Jose State University, where I specialized in data science and advanced analytics. During the program, I worked on a range of projects that involved data mining, fine-tuning deep learning models, and applying machine learning techniques to address real-world challenges. This experience helped me improve my skills in understanding complex data.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm looking for roles where I can apply a mix of engineering experience and advanced data science knowledge to build scalable, innovative solutions. If you're seeking someone who can bridge the gap between software development and machine learning, let's connect!
